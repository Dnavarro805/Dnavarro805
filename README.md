Software Engineer with a proven ability to collaborate effectively on teams of varying size and talent composition. My passion
for ensuring that my creative deliverables are consistently of the highest artistic and functional quality ensured strong demand
for my work in what was a successful 5-year career in the live entertainment industry; I performed 200+ events generating
$40K+ in revenue. My drive for constant personal growth led me through 4 years of university courses wherein I learned
fundamental theory and practicality using Python, Java, C, and C++. I am now excited to apply my skills on larger development
teams, take on more challenging problems, and aid in maximizing productivity while continuing to learn, grow, and collaborate
with both teammates and clients.
